# Statistical Computing

This module revolved around the branch of computational mathematics which studies computational techniques for situations
which either directly involve randomness, or where randomness is used as part of a mathematical method. 

In the assessed coursework, I investigated the use of computational techniques leveraging the use of randomness,with a focus on Monte Carlo methods to find insights.
